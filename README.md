## MyReads Project

### Description

This app allows users to search for books by title or author using a fixed set of keywords(see [Search_Terms](Search_Terms.md)) and add books to shelves
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Once a book is added to the shelf using the button control on each book it shows up in the corresponding shelf.
Books can be moved across shelves using the same controls accordingly

Each book shows the title, author(s), average rating and reviews and a description (tooltip)
When searching for books, user can filter search results based on average rating
